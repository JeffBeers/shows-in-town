# Shows In Town
*A web app to compile and display information for live music shows in Louisville, Kentucky*

There is not one central repository for concerts in Louisville - music lovers in town need a single source of truth for all the possible shows on a given day/night. Most musicians and venues post only their own gigs. There are some organizations that try to compile events but all (at least, to my knowledge) require people to submit their own content and, so, are nowhere near compiling all gigs in town. **Shows In Town** attempts to solve this problem by creating an open source platform for compiling and displaying basic event information that our community of local musician/developers can contribute their own scrapers to over time.


## How to contribute




## Scrapers
*The approach to scaling this app will be to gradually pull event data from more venues, musicians' sites, organization calendars, etc.*
